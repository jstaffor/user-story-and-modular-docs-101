= User story and modular docs

This document teaches you to create documentation that is based on a user story, and is created using a Modular Docs framework.
The Modular Docs framework consists of four templates:

* An assembly template.
* A concept template.
* A procedure template.
* A reference template.

If you create documentation to this framework, the end result is a documentation set that is modular by design.
