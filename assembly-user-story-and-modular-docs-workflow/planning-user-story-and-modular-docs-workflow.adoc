= Planning for user story and modular docs workflow

Determine the user stories that are required for each of the headings in the table of contents.
Consider the heading and think about what the Customer will want to achieve for the given heading.
Each user story will be represented as an assembly file.
Once the user stories have been determined, flesh out the user stories with the templates (a concept file, a procedure file, and a reference file) from a Modular Docs framework.
